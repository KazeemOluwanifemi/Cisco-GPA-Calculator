        <li><b>Set specific goals:</b> Achieving 
          your goals depends heavily on how well you can 
          manage your time. Making a priority pie is one way you can plan 
          how you will efficiently divide your time in your forthcoming semester.

        <li><b>Be resilient: </b>Even with a good plan, obstacles will arise. 
          How well you deal with those obstacles depends on your perspective.
          If you lean toward a fixed mindset, the good news is that it is not permanent. 
          No one falls into one mindset 100 percent of the time. 
          Training your brain to see opportunity where you once saw a 
          roadblock is possible. <b><em>“It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. 
            Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way, even by death, 
            and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment.”</em> ― Bram Stoker, Dracula</b>
